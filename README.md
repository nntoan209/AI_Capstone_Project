# AI_Capstone_Project

This is a group project for the Introduction to Artificial Intelligent course. This project uses searching algorithms like Astar, Greedy BFS, Uniform cost search to find the shortest way between 2 random points on the image of the map of Mars. Furthermore, we using different methods and parameters, and compare the effect on the running time of the algorithms. 

This project is the work of 5 members:
